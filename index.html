        <p> Clone is an orginasm that is an exact genetic copy of onther orginasm.
        </p>
    <p>
        Clone can occur in tow ways
    </p>
    <li>
    Nutual way
    </li>
    
   <li>
       Lab way
   </li>
            <p>
                Today we will BE only emphasizing Cloning in lab

            This is dolly

                dolly is the first successful mammol cloned.
                she was cloned after scientist figerout, how to remove the DNA egg cell 
                of a male sheep, and besicaly replace with the DNA momor of a famale shee,
                than a little bit of electric shook to fuse the cells and get it duble, after 
                that put the cells in utru of onther animal(sheep), and boom dolly was cloned.s
